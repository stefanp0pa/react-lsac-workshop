-> Why Tailwind CSS (vs. Bootstrap)

-> customization, and the Bootstrap classes are fairly limited and you are kind of stuck with them
-> if you don't like something specifically, you have to override with inline-styles in Bootstrap

-> Why not use Tailwind?
	- if you do not know CSS enough, Tailwind may be a little tougher to employ
	- if you are in a rush, Bootstrap is better for prototyping
